# 202405102130 People can and should change in love relationships

[#love]() [#relationships]()

Most people like to say that people can't change, and if they acted bad they will always be that way, and that's why we
should be careful when choosing a partner, because all of their characteristics will be **permanent**.

No need to say how unbelievable is that thought, since we all are adaptable creatures, and we as people usually acted
in a bad way because of many reasons, most of them because of other people behaviour, parents raising, or past trauma.

Therefore, if there was room to change early in life, there's always a chance for people to change, and they should! A
lot of people fail in love because they are so focused on searching for the perfect people (or wishing other people to
be perfect), and this is impossible.

_"If we search only for perfect people to be around us, our social environment will become really poor."_

- [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success - Carol S. Dweck]

Thus the need of self improvement, and always pushing the other to improve as well, in a calm and communicative manner,
so that any type of bad behaviour can be erradicated with **change**, not with accusations and drama.

I've met some people in my life that refused to believe in this statements, that people can change and communication is
key, and the experience with those people was remarkably bad.
